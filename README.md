# Fetal Heartbeat

# Notebook
1. Imports at the beginning of Notebook
2. Notebook should be runnable form top to bottom -> function declarations before the usage of a function
3. Use markdowns properly to make the Notebook more readable 

# Overall
1. Good documentation of functions
2. Seperate results and experiments

# Ideas
1. Use ICA to seperate Heartbeat of fetus and mother
2. Check frequency of periodic channel and check how many spikes per second do we have?
3. is this related to the frequency of the heartbeat?
